The Edit Class Properties dialog allows the user to modify the <a href="Main_Window.htm#Category_Filter">Category</a>
and <a href="Main_Window.htm#Tree_Filter_Toolbar">Detail Level</a> for a Class.  The dialog is displayed
when the user selects Properties from the <a href="Main_Window.htm#Popup_Menu">Popup Menu</a>.</p>

<h4>
Class Name</h4>
<p class="Base">
The Class Name is displayed for reference purposes and cannot be changed.</p>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
Category</h4>
<p class="Base">
The field is only available for editing on base classes (ie classes that are not derived).  For filtering
purposes, all derived classes are considered to be in the same Category as the base class from which they
are derived.</p>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Base">
To specify a category for a non-base class, you must use one of the following options:</p>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<UL><LI><p class="Bullet1">The category is extracted from the optional <i>FamilyClass</i> parameter that
can be added to the <b>!ABCIncludeFile(</b><b><i>FamilyClass</i></b><b>)</b> comment line that identifies
ABC Classes.  </p></LI>
<LI><p class="Bullet1">For Non-ABC Classes the program also recognizes a <b>!Category(</b><b><i>Category</i></b><b>)</b>
comment line.</p></LI></UL>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
Detail Level</h4>
<p class="Base">
Use the spin control or enter a number in the range 0 to 9  where 0 represents the least and 9 represents
the most detail.</p>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Base">
The detail level allows the program to fine tune how much detail is presented in the tree view.  Most
classes are assigned a detail level of 1 when they are initially scanned.  There are some basic classes
[<a href="javascript:ShowPopup('Basic_Class_List.htm', 0, 490, 109)">see list</a>] that are assigned detail
level 0.  This was done to allow the program to present a simple view to the beginner while providing
a feature for advanced users that permits fine tuning of the amount of detail presented in the tree view.
This feature would be particularly useful in controlling the presentation of derived classes.</p>
