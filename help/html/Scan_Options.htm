<h4>
Redirection File</h4>
<p class="Base">
The redirection file is the primary mechanism used by Class Viewer to determine what folders need to be
scanned.  The default value is the standard redirection file for the version of Clarion that has been
selected.  The user can override this file prior to scanning by pressing the ellipsis button to the right
of the field.  A file dialog is displayed to allow the user to select a redirection file.</p>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
Current Directory</h4>
<p class="Base">
Inside the redirection file it is common to use a '.' to represent the current directory.  To use a path
other that the program startup folder as the current directory, press the ellipsis button to the right
of the field.  A file dialog is displayed to allow the user to select a folder.</p>
<p class="Base">
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
Include Standard Equate Files</h4>
<p class="Base">
Use the check boxes it select the standard equate files to be included in the scan.  By default, the scan
process only scans the class inc and clw files.  There are several other standard files that contain items
that may be of interest to the user and the check boxes provide a convenient way to specify the inclusions
desired.</p>

on the number and size of the files to be scanned.  Leave this option unchecked to use the <i>Smart Scan</i>
feature and only files that are new or have changed since the last scan will be processed.</p>
<p class="Base">
